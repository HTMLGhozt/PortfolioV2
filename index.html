      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        'Hello, World!' is a programming convention often
        used to introduce the syntax of a new language.
        I thought it appropriate to introduce myself the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Thomas. I am a student of the Lambda Academy of 
        Computer Science (Lambda School), graduating April 20, 2018.
        I have been focusing on the development of full stack applications
        utilizing React and Node for front-end and server-side,
        respectively. While attending Lambda, I have developed and 
        assisted in the development of several applications, the most
        enterprising being an unnamed Tour Application. During Lambda
        School's 2018 24 hour winter hackathon I lead a team to win
        the Teacher's Choice Award for over-all application. Outside
        of the academy I experiment with game development and font design.
      </p>

        Lambda School focuses on the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React,
        and Node) used for interactive single page applications (SPAs).
        In conjunction with the MERN stack Lambda also teaches SQL, Redux,
        React Native, Knex, Less, and more. While JavaScript is their most
        comprehensively covered language, Lambda School provides students
        a familiarity with C and Python as well.
